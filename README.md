## Introduction
Our project aims to create an interactive platform that makes learning geography fun, engaging, and accessible. By challenging users to identify countries based on various clues, we hope to enhance their geographic knowledge across multiple domains. With this goal in mind, we designed the project to be user-friendly, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. Hope you enjoy...


## Technologies
* [Springboot](https://spring.io/) - Java framework to create a micro service
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - Automated building and management tool

## High-level components
dentify your project’s 3-5 main components. What is their role?
How are they correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text
with a link



## Launch & Deployment

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier:)

- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesn’t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Learn More

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).


## Illustrations
In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s)
of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to
include a few screenshots of your application.

## Roadmap
* Our web application is mostly mobile-friendly, but some pages may still require improvements in scaling for optimal viewing on different devices. Or another idea in this area would be to implement everything in an app.
* An extension of the amount and type of hints available to guess the country.
